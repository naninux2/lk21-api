## Getting Started

### Installation

**Step 1:** Clone this repository.


**Step 2:** Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and complete the required [environment variables](#environment-variables).

**Step 3:** Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 4:** Enable Git hooks and compile the TypeScript code.

```bash
npm run prepare && npm run build
```

**Step 5:** *(Optional)* Set up Redis for caching.

```bash
# Install and start Redis server
redis-server

# Or using Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

**Step 6:** Run the project.

```bash
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

The target URLs have the potential to change at any time because their servers are extremely vulnerable to being blocked. Therefore, I declared the target URLs in the Node environment variables.

```bash
# LK21 (LayarKaca21) URL
LK21_URL = https://tv.lk21official.live

# NontonDrama URL
ND_URL = https://tv.nontondrama.lol

# Redis configuration (optional)
REDIS_URL = redis://localhost:6379
CACHE_TTL = 30
```

### Redis Caching

This API includes Redis caching to improve performance and reduce load on scraped websites. Caching is especially beneficial for:

- **Heavy Playwright operations** (series details, episode streaming)
- **Movie listings and search results**
- **Genre, country, and year data**

**Benefits:**
- ðŸš€ **Faster response times** - Cached responses served instantly
- ðŸ”„ **Reduced scraping load** - Less requests to target websites  
- ðŸŽ­ **Browser overhead reduction** - Playwright operations cached
- ðŸ“Š **Configurable TTL** - Set cache duration via `CACHE_TTL` (default: 30 seconds)

**Setup:**
1. Install Redis: `brew install redis` (macOS) or [download for Windows](https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases)
2. Start Redis: `redis-server`
3. The API will automatically use caching when Redis is available

**Note:** The API works perfectly fine without Redis - it just won't have caching benefits.
